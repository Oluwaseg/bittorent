Hello, this is a sample file for testing our BitTorrent client!

This file contains some text that we can use to test the downloading functionality.
The BitTorrent protocol will split this file into pieces and download them from peers.

Features of our BitTorrent client:
- Parses .torrent files using bencode
- Communicates with trackers via UDP
- Downloads from multiple peers simultaneously
- Handles pieces and blocks efficiently
- Reconstructs the original file

This is a great example of peer-to-peer file sharing technology!
